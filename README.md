According to the World Health Organization, taking the equivalent of 10,000 steps daily is the minimum activity required to keep fit, maintain health and control weight. This everyday activity is not only essential to prevent the risk of developing certain serious conditions: cancer, diabetes... but it also improves our quality of life (better sleep quality, reduced stress) and this whatever the age. 

When you have a sedentary job, or are an engineering student, spending your days behind a computer, as is increasingly the case today, it is not always easy to take 10,000 steps a day. 

That is why, when I arrived in Turkey, I set myself the goal of taking my 10,000 steps a day. And in addition, nothing better than walking to discover all the corners of a new country. 

My exchange semester is coming to the end, so itâ€™s time to take stock !
To track my step count, I use the Health app, integrated directly into my iPhone. So, I had the idea to use my apple health data as analytical data for this project. And you will discover that we can analyze many other things, in addition to the number of steps, with the data of this application.
